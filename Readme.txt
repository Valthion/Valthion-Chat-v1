To start a session, start the server.exe first. Then, run client.exe to start chatting.

Known Issues:
1. Once the server started and clients connected, server can't handle clients that attempts to reconnecting after closing the app.
   To solve this, close all clients and the server to start a new session.

2. Entering a wrong IP address on client.exe will crash the app.
